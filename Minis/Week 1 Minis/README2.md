BIG THANK YOU to @Redeat who cleaned up the original downloaded bank database schema and data population file (LearningSQLExample.sql).  

She made available to the entire class her new clean file (postgre_SqlScript.sql).

For reference, I have left both files in this folder.

Each homework problem from the assignment is named according to its exercise number.  So for example, file 3-1.sql corresponds to Exercise 3-1.
